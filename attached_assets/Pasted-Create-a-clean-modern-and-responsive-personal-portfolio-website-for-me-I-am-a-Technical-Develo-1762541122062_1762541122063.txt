Create a clean, modern, and responsive personal portfolio website for me.

I am a Technical Developer who works in a research-support organization. My role involves building tools, web platforms, automation scripts, and reports that help convert data into actionable insights.

My unique strength is combining web development and research report writing — meaning I can not only develop the tools but also create publication-ready documentation and reports in formats like APA, IEEE, and Harvard.

🧩 The portfolio should include the following sections:

1️⃣ Home / Hero Section:

My name: Ashish Gautam

Title: Technical Developer | Research Report Writer | Data Visualization & Automation

Short tagline: I build web tools and data-driven reports that turn research into impact.

A “Hire Me” button that scrolls to the Contact section.
